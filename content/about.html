<p>I remember a time of surplus stores and great technologies. I remember <a href="https://www.bunkerofdoom.com/nortex/">Nortex Electronics</a>, and good friends who met there.
Pj, the ham radio operator and broadcast video technician; Paul, the vintage audiophile, jukebox collector, and video camera repairman;
Steve, who fixed large electroplating machines; William Waggoner, the high-desert import diesel mechanic; Ed, the optics guy; Mike the calculator collector (among other things) and who can forget Andre and Jimmy.
And the Navy veteran who ran the place, Lewis Cearly, one of the kindest men I've ever met.
And I was the kid looking for capacitors for a tesla coil. I recall the old stories which were exchanged. We never did figure out where all those left-handed gloves came from - that was Nortex.
The place was a sight to behold, lined with oscilloscopes and full of rare wonders and more tubes than I had ever seen before or since in one place; and it seemed to just go on and on. Nothing lasts forever, but it was the time of our lives while it did last.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I find a certain appeal, a certain beauty in old technology; it's durability, it's potential. The certain timeless quality of the old way of doing things - by hand.
  I hope to share this with those who can also appreciate it.</p>
